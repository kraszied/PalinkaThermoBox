PalinkaThermoBox control application

Testing
=======

For testing purpose the PalinkaThermoBoxSimulator project is created. It simulates the server (PalinkaThermoBox) the protocol is not known yet 
therefore the command processing is a dummy in it but it can be easily changed to the appropriate one. The bluetooth connection can be tested with it. 
For the connection test the RemoteBluetooth project is added. Install the application on Android device and you can test the connection the PalinkaThermoBoxSimulator has to be running on desktop.
